Registering Your Team
---------------------

To register your team [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/),
add your team to the list of teams in this `README.md` file
and make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
so we can pull the changes back into our repository.

To add your team to the list,
just add a line under the *Teams* heading like this one:

```md
- [Your Project Name](https://github.com/you/your-project) by Your Team
```

If you need help with the pull request process,
